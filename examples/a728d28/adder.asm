                         ;   yielding a partial sum.

    andrl                ;   is still in L), bitwise AND them and rotate the

                         ;   sum of the two initial numbers. At this point we
                         ;   once again have two numbers that we have to sum,

    ld r0 | brc loop     ; * Load one of the numbers so the loop can start over.
                         ; * If the bitwise AND has yielded no set bits, the
                         ;   algorithm terminates as the two numbers had no
                         ;   overlapping parts, meaning the sum of their
                         ;   non-overlapping parts is exactly their sum.
